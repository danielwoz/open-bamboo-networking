// Minimal RTSP / RTSPS client for Bambu Lab printers.
//
// Bambu's X1 / P1S / P2S firmware exposes the camera as an RTSP-over-TLS
// stream on port 322 with H.264 inside RTP/TCP-interleaved packets.
// The official libBambuSource ships an embedded live555 client to read
// it; we replace that with a hand-rolled client small enough to live
// next to the rest of libBambuSource and free of the version-skew
// problems we hit when trying to dlopen system libavformat (whose
// DT_NEEDED libavutil clashed with the older libavutil that Studio's
// AppImage already had loaded -- see README).
//
// What this client does *not* do, on purpose:
//   - UDP transport. Bambu always negotiates TCP-interleaved; offering
//     UDP would just add a fallback path no real printer takes.
//   - Plain RTSP without TLS. The URL parser still accepts rtsp:// for
//     symmetry / test fixtures, but Bambu never serves it.
//   - Digest authentication. Every printer firmware we have looked at
//     speaks Basic; if a future revision returns 401, start() reports
//     an error and the caller's "could not authenticate" surface fires
//     (we did not want to ship a half-tested Digest path that nobody
//     can actually exercise today).
//   - Random RTSP servers. The SDP parser is good enough for Bambu's
//     output but is not a general-purpose SDP implementation; in
//     particular it expects a single H.264 video track, payload type
//     advertised via `a=rtpmap`, parameter sets via `sprop-parameter-sets`,
//     and a track URL given by `a=control:`.
//
// Threading: start() / read_nalu() / stop() are *not* thread-safe with
// each other. The intended pattern is one producer thread driving
// read_nalu() in a loop and another thread calling stop() exactly
// once. cancel() is the only call that may be made from any thread:
// it shuts the socket down to break the producer out of an in-flight
// SSL_read. The 15-second GET_PARAMETER keepalive runs on its own
// internal thread that the client owns.
